We&#8217;re coming close to GNOME 2.30 release date, and we are getting ready to branch a stable release off of WebKit&#8217;s svn trunk in preparation for that. The idea of the stable branch is to try to maintain, and improve stability, with no additional features going in. Speaking of features, though, if you&#8217;ve been paying attention you will have noticed WebKitGTK+ has come a long way, now.

We came from not having basic features such as [download support][1] or openning links in new tabs, a [more-or-less working HTML5 media implementation][2], and very few or missing in action developers to a thriving project, that gets more, and more attention, and contributors every day, with [advanced features available][3], and rocking HTML5 media support that leaves little to be desired. It&#8217;s been just over one year since [we started rolling mostly bi-weekly releases][4], each adding more awesome features.

There are still many issues, and we are not always equipped as a team to handle all the specifics of the engine ourselves, but I am really happy with the progress we&#8217;ve made, and really thankful for the support my employerÂ [Collabora][5] has given all the way for this to happen, including the early work on plugins, and many other things before my time as a contributor. When I switched to using Epiphany with the WebKit backend as my default browser back in January 2009, that meant having to deal with a whole lot of misbehaviour, and work-around a lot of painful brokeness. These days I enjoy a snappy, functional browser that makes me happy.

If you haven&#8217;t done so yet, go download, and test the newest Epiphany, with the [latest WebKitGTK+][6], and help us make the GNOME 2.30&#8217;s web browser rock even more!
