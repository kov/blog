Last week I attended the WebKitGTK+ 2010 hackfest. It was a great opportunity to meet up with the other developers, discuss some plans for the future, hack away at WebKitGTK+. But, most importantly, play Street Figher 2 =). Thanks to Collabora and Igalia for sponsoring the hackfest, Igalia for hosting and organizing it (well done!), and the GNOME foundation for having sponsored my trip to Coruña!

Unlike last year we didn&#8217;t find any big design issues hurting our work (page cache, I&#8217;m looking at you!) on new futures. I also didn&#8217;t have any huge plans for new API, although we did manage to get some new stuff in there, like the plugins management API Xan created, and the further work done by Dan in soup. This meant, from my point of view the hackfest has been a great oportunity to look at refactorings that we could do to further simplify understanding the code, changing it, and even sharing it =). Besides pushing the debian packaging of the 1.3.x series a bit further.

Coruña was great as always, and I enjoyed going around, eating and hacking there, although I got a cold on the last days which kinda hindered my ability to stare at the screen for too long, some times. Now that I&#8217;m at the hot brazilian summer again I&#8217;ll hopefully get better soon =)

Cheers \o/
