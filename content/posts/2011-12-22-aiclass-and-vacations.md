One of my side projects for these last months was to enroll on the online [Introduction to AI class][1], with Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun, professors at Stanford. Through it I also learned about the [Kahn Academy][2]. I must say that getting to know these efforts made me feel similar to when I found Free Software: it&#8217;s hard to believe that such great things exist!

I learned some really cool stuff, and was also introduced to the amazing work of Sebastian Thrun with self-driving cars, it was an awesome experience! Last weekend I took the final exam, and today I got the certificate of accomplishment. It was delivered as a [signed PDF][3] which can be checked with a [certificate they provided][4], pretty neat. I&#8217;m very happy, and motivated to enroll on more such courses in the future =). Now it&#8217;s time to cool down, though. My vacations start today, and on the weekend I&#8217;ll travel to the sunny Fortaleza, in northeastern Brazil, to enjoy some nice beaches and get some tan. See you next year!
